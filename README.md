> Engineering insights from 13+ years building distributed systems at scale

## 👋 About

Senior Software Engineer with deep expertise in distributed systems, cloud architecture, and emerging AI technologies. This blog documents learnings, architectural patterns, and technical insights from building large-scale systems at Amazon and beyond.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- **Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems** - Design patterns for LLM-based agents, tool use, orchestration
- **Distributed Systems** - Scalability patterns, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance
- **Enterprise Integration** - Message-driven architectures, event sourcing, saga patterns  
- **AWS Architecture** - Cloud-native design, serverless, microservices
- **System Design** - Architectural decision-making, simplicity principles
